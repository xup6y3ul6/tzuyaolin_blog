    "text": "Abstract\nCultural consensus theory (CCT), developed by Batchelder and colleagues in the mid-1980s, is a cognitively driven methodology to assess informants’ consensus in which the culturally correct answers are unknown to researchers a priori. The primary goal of CCT is to uncover the cultural knowledge, preferences or beliefs shared by group members. One of the CCT models, called the {\\em general Condorcet model} (GCM), deals with dichotomous (e.g., true/false) response data which are collected from a group of informants who share the same cultural knowledge. We propose a new model, called the {\\em general Condorcet-Luce-Krantz} (GCLK) model, which incorporates the GCM with the Luce-Krantz threshold theory. The GCLK accounts for ordinal categorical data (including Likert-type questionnaires) in which informants can express confidence levels when answering the items/questions. In addition to finding out the consensus truth to the items, the GCLK also estimates other response characteristics, including the item-difficulty levels, informants’ competency levels, and guessing biases. We introduce the multicultural version of the GCLK that can help researchers detect the number of cultures for a given data set. We use the hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach and the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method for estimation. A posterior predictive check is established to verify the central assumptions of the model. Through a series of simulations, we evaluate the model’s applicability and find that the GCLK performs well on parameter recovery.\nKeywords: cultural consensus theory, hierarchical Bayesian model, latent class model, ordinal categorical data, response confidence, threshold theory"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Conference: The 10th European Congress of Methodology (EAM 2023)\nLocation: Ghent University, Belgium\nTime: 10-07-2023 ~ 13-07-2023\nTitle: Reliability for multilevel data: A correlation approach\nAbstract: Studying the reliability of a measurement instrument is essential. Despite the awareness of the problem of measurement errors in psychology and medicine and the various reliability coefficients that have been proposed, research on reliability for multilevel data, which ubiquitously exist in observational studies, remains limited. Two recent papers (Schönbrodt et al., 2022; ten Hove et al., 2022) address how to quantify reliability in multilevel settings based on generalizability theory. Specifically, ten Hove et al. (2022) defined between-cluster and within-cluster interrater intraclass correlation coefficients for multilevel designs where subjects or raters are nested within clusters. Schönbrodt et al. (2022) also defines reliability coefficients at betweencluster and within-cluster (i.e., between-subject) levels for designs where dyad members nested in couples are assessed numerous times daily over a number of days. Nevertheless, both approaches give inconsistent results regarding their definition of cluster-level reliability. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to define reliability coefficients that are based on calculating the expected correlation between repeated measurements (Molenberghs et al., 2007; Vangeneugden et al., 2005). We will compare our approach with that of Schönbrodt et al. (2022) and ten Hove et al. (2022) and explain the differences between the three approaches in two common nested data structures: (1) raters crossed with both subjects and clusters, but subjects are nested within clusters and (2) raters nested within both subjects and clusters. To conclude, we will provide guidelines to measure reliability in multilevel data structures.\nSlide:\n\n  \n    This browser does not support PDFs.
