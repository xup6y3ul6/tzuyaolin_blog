## Bio

Hi there! I'm a joint PhD student at Maastricht University and KU Leuven, studying reliability for intensive longitudinal data. I'm also an R enthusiast, a fire dancer, and a Lindy hopper. In my blog, I aim to share useful knowledge and interesting things. On one hand, I hope to explain concepts in simple language. On the other hand, I want to organize my thoughts structurally and deepen their place in my memory. I firmly believe that writing aids thinking, and now is the time to put that into practice â€“ even though I've disliked writing for as long as I can remember!
