Welcome to my blog, where I'll be sharing my academic research progress, including my papers, study notes, and my work with R language, statistics, and psychology. Of course, I'll also be sharing my personal thoughts and experiences.

So, why I want to build a personal blog. The reason is simple. It's time to share what I know!

When you've written the same code 3 times, write a function<br><br>When you've given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post

Although I haven't quite figured out what this blog will look like yet, let's get started and worry about the details later. Anyway, thanks for joining me on this journey!
