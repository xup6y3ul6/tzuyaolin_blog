# Abstract

Cultural consensus theory (CCT), developed by Batchelder and colleagues in the mid-1980s, is a cognitively driven methodology to assess informants' consensus in which the culturally correct answers are unknown to researchers a priori. The primary goal of CCT is to uncover the cultural knowledge, preferences or beliefs shared by group members. One of the CCT models, called the {\\em general Condorcet model} (GCM), deals with dichotomous (e.g., true/false) response data which are collected from a group of informants who share the same cultural knowledge. We propose a new model, called the {\\em general Condorcet-Luce-Krantz} (GCLK) model, which incorporates the GCM with the Luce-Krantz threshold theory. The GCLK accounts for ordinal categorical data (including Likert-type questionnaires) in which informants can express confidence levels when answering the items/questions. In addition to finding out the consensus truth to the items, the GCLK also estimates other response characteristics, including the item-difficulty levels, informants' competency levels, and guessing biases. We introduce the multicultural version of the GCLK that can help researchers detect the number of cultures for a given data set. We use the hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach and the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method for estimation. A posterior predictive check is established to verify the central assumptions of the model. Through a series of simulations, we evaluate the model's applicability and find that the GCLK performs well on parameter recovery.
